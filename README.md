# Personal Portfolio Website

## Purpose
This personal website serves as a platform to showcase my professional projects and skills. It was initiated due to space constraints on my resume, which limited my ability to fully demonstrate my work and land in a software engineer job.

## Features
- **Project Showcase:** The website provides a comprehensive display of my projects, allowing visitors to gain insight into my capabilities and experiences.
- **Skills Highlight:** It highlights my skillset, offering a detailed overview of the competencies I bring to the table.
- **Night Mode:** Recognizing the importance of eye comfort during extended screen time, the website includes a "night" mode option for easier viewing in low-light environments.

## Future Development
I plan to continually expand this platform by adding more projects and incorporating additional features to enhance user experience and engagement.
