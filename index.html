                    <p>In this project, I created a videogame in C and C++ to play in the terminal. The user has to complete the Maze to win the game. The user can move the character with the arrow keys and use the space bar to shoot enemies. The user can also choose to not continue to finish the game or press start to play again. The game will randomize the maze each time to ensure a unique experience.</p>

                    <p>In this project, we used the ATmega 328PB Xplained Mini to check the water temperature using a Thermistor NTC 10K Ohm and an ultrasonic sensor. The system avoids overflow when the water reaches the desired distance by using green and red LEDs to trigger a buzzer sound when the water reaches the distance.</p>

                    <p>The project entails the development of a comprehensive rental car system program. Users have the capability to navigate through our database seamlessly, allowing them to explore and check the availability of various cars. The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface in the terminal, making it easy for customers to access relevant information such as car details, rental rates, and current availability.</p>
